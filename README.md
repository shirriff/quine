# Quine scarf

Create a quine scarf. The idea is to create a scarf that includes the program used to create it.

Quine scarves (and other cool algorithmically generated knitwear) are for sale (not by me) at [knityak.com](http://knityak.com).

Run "python quine.py" to produce quine.png, an image of quine.py.
