# Quine scarf

Create a quine scarf. The idea is to create a scarf that includes the program used to create it.

Run "python quine.py" to produce quine.png, an image of quine.py.

Run "python quine2.py" to produce q.png, an image of quine2.py with a nicer background.

This code uses the Pillow image library. Installation details [here](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.4.x/installation.html). Summary: `pip install Pillow`
